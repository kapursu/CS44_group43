To implement the best fit algorithm, we will be editing the function slob_page_alloc in mm/slob.c . This is the only file and function that will need to be altered. Our implementation will mirror that found on:https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2017/01/best-fit-algorithm-c-c.html
Get no. of Processes and no. of blocks.
After that get the size of each block and process requests.
Then select the best memory block that can be allocated using the above definition.
Display the processes with the blocks that are allocated to a respective process.
Value of Fragmentation is optional to display to keep track of wasted memory.
Stop.
